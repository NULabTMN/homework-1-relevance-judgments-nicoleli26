	<text>1 The latest fad in the line of
T physical culture Is barrel
rolling. Nowadays both men
and women may be found
who daily make It a duty to
exercise for a certain length
of time with a common, everyday barrel.
Corpulent people may now rejoice, for
this latest acquisition to the catalogue of
health and figure improvement methods
has been proven to do everything claimed
for it.
. Thin, sickly people may also join th*
chorus, for it not only reduces flesh with
fleshy individuals, but makes flesh atd
muscle. Improves the breathing apparatus,
invigorates the action of the heart and
brings about a graceful carriage.
All the properties needed consist of ,a
small barrel or keg. The exercise may
be taken in a bedroom, although out of
doors is better. >\
Barrel-rolling, like all other kinds of
exercise, must be taken In regulated!
doses. The man who goes at It like ha
woulJ to a fire will realize little real bene
fit He will derive the greatest who
makes it a business as well as a pleas
ure, begins on a small scale and works up
to his greatest capacity gradually and
naturally. .
The exercises given in the following are
prepared especially for those who are
earnest erough to have a try with this
new method and who will be really con-
scientious in their work.
For the first exercise the barrel Is laid
on the floor on its rolling surface.' The
body should be so arranged that only the
tips of the fingers and the palms of the
hands touch the floor, the greater weight
of the body ing borne by the keg. The
body should then be propelled forward,
the hands being used for that, purpose.
The legs and arms must be kept as rigid
'as possible, and the feet must not be
moved until the barrel, moving naturally
downward, reaches the knee. Now re
verse the movement, pushing backward
with the hands until the barrel is rolled
up to the arms. This exercise should be
repeated several times. It is the most '
important of all for reducing the weight,
although It tends equally with the fol
lowing, others to develop the arms,
broaden the chest and make the abdom
inal muscles flexible.
The second exercise Is practically the
reverse of the.first. Rest with the back
en the cask this time. Place the arms
downward, and rest the heels on the floor
—the heels only, mind; no other part of
the legs. In order to get the barrel in
motion, move the arms alternately as far
forward as possible. The cask will then
reach the heels, the body being raised
from the floor. As before, reverse this
movement and "bring the cask up to the
small of the back, still taking care to
keep the legs stretched out straight.
"While performing this exercise, keep the
lungs well filled, the stomach drawn in
and the chest expanded. When the keg
is up to the part of the back referred to
lift th* arms from the floor and extend
them along the side of the body.* with
open palms on hip. Keep this position as
long 1 as possible without strain.
The third exercise is a pretty one. It
la performed by lying with the left side
of the body, just above the hip, resting
'on the" barrel. If you wonder why, in the
picture, the right hand is upraised, you
will know as soon as you begin the exer
cise. vlt is to balance the body, for the
feet qnly touch the floor. "With your left
hand pull your body forward as far as
possible until the feet can be raised from
the floor. This is not as easy as it looks,
but a little perseverance will manage it.
Then move back to the former position.
.When this exercise has been fairly well
jnnEtered, repeat it. but by lying on the
richt side of the body and holding the
hft hand in the air. This exercise is
liable \to strain the body if it is perse
vered In with too much zeal, and care
should, therefore, be taken to be conser
vative.
The fourth movement consists of lying
with the back on the cask, the arms, at
first, folded. This, while appearing to be
similar to exercise number two, is quite
. rent, for here the feet only are U3ed
to force the body over the barrel until
the latter has reached the shoulders anl
back of the head, when the arms are then
placed at the side, as in the illustration.
As in the second exercise, do not neglect,
while in ■'his position, to keep the stom
ach drawn in and the chest expanded. No
person with a weak back should prac
tice this movement, for the strain upon
the neck is rather severe, and an acci
dent might be attended with unpleasant
consequences.
The fifth is a fine exercise, easy, grace
ful and at the same time beneficial. Stand
straight up, with the feet together, stom
ach in. chest out, shoulders square, and
head back. Place the small barrel first
upon the toes. Bend down and grasp hold
of it. and bring it, not too quickly, up to
the waist line and thence above the head.
Hold it there for a second or two, being
sure that your figure is perfectly
straight. . - - !V ' :.>.
A good method of regulating the breath
ing apparatus, the functions of which are
rather severely drawn upon in this exer
cise, is to count, one, two, three, four,
etc., at each swing-up of the cask, and
inhale air through the nostrils - only at
the even numbers, two, four, six, and so
on. ■■>:. . ' :
The sixth exercise follows naturally
from the fifth. Raise the cask from the
toes to the chin line, still keeping the
body rigid, though the legs may bo
stretched a trifle apart, to preserve the
equilibrium, and swing the barrel to the
right and the left alternately. Follow
the same rules about breathing as in the
preceding movement.
The next exercise, the seventh, is one
which can be done expertly only by the
man who has Indulged in this form of
• barrel-rolling exercise for some time, but
so many parts of the body are brought
Crumbling Skull of
HE famous "Lansing" skull,
T discovered last February in
Kansas, and recently exam
ined by a learned committee
of scientific men, is pro
nounced by them to have
belonged to a man who lived 35,000 years
ago.
This would malce the "Lansing" skull
the oldest relic of prehistoric man on the
American continent, antedating by some
few thousands of years all the other re
mains of human existence on this side of
the Atlantic, and belonging to the same
geo'.ogical period as the oldest relics of
Europe. ,
Although the skull was discovered some
months ago, It was not until quite re
cently that it was fully and scientifically '
described. It was dug from a iiillside of
the Concannon farm, about three miles
from Lansing, Kas., and within a very
few feet of the channel of the Missouri
river. Two men were making an excava
tion for a cave in which to store apples,
when they came across the fragments of
the ekull, loosely imbedded in the soil and
partly disintegrated.
Prof. S. W. Wiiliston, formerly of thß
Kansas state university, but how of the
choir of paleontology ol the Chicago uni-
into play during It that nothing should
be neglected to bring one's salf to the
pitch of necessary ability. Stretch the
legs so that the feet are apart about
twenty-four inches. Then swing the bar
rel down briskly between the legs and
Tiigh up over the head, bending the back
and allowing the knees to bend slightly
forward as the barrel passes under the
body.
Go slowly about this exercise, for It is,
as has been intimated, no small strain
over the whole of the body, and it is not
one to be performed by the weakling. Yet
the weakling can easily get to it by prac
ticing the previous exercises. It is a
matter only of degree. Keep the lungs
partly filled as you exhale, because it la
neceesary to use the thoracic and ab
dominal muscles, for the Improvement of
which this exercise has been partly de
signed.
The cask ls placed In a novel position
for the eighth exercise—as far a? the
body Is concerned. That Is. one must re
cline upon it stretched lengthwise in the
tame direction as the body. Place th?
hands on the floor In front and let the
toes, the tips of which touch the ground,
support your legs.
Now roll from left to right, or the bar
rel from right to left, according to the
way of looking at It. Refrain from be
coming too enthusiastic at this pastime,
or the barrel will slip away from under
you and you may flatten your face
against the surface of the floor or
ground.</text>

H around exercise is capital; no one will din
put c that, but it is possible that certain parts
of your anatomy require further development,
thai may be pained by certain forms of exercise
that bring muscles into play. .
For example, swimming develops the rniiFclc
of the chest, arms, limbs, and abdomen, but its
greatest benefit lies in its powcrB of increasing
the circulation through reactionary causes. Row
ing, also brings into active condition both nius-J
cle aud blood.

the racquet will cause the left arm to have th
appearance of being lop-sided.
When a girl is ambidextrous she can keep tho
development of both t-ides equal. And though
it may be tedious and uninteresting for a good
player to start all over again by playing villi tbu
left hand, it is worth all the trouble in the end.
In golf both hauda are used, and the mighty
swings not only stretch the musclcn of the arms,
but the chest and back as well. Add to this tho
benefit of walking over tho links. .
Horseback riding is a most excellent form of
exercise, advised by doctors and physical cultu
rists alike.

Your bones will ache and your muscles vnll be

when you are uuaccustdmcd to it will produce

The benefits of walking arc well known. This,
the most common form of exercise, is recommend
ed for fleshy people who wish to part with their
superfluous flesh, but the lean kind need not
worry- When walking is not too strenuously a
plied it is a most excellent all around exercise,
made doubly beneficial when the practice of cor
rect breathing becomes a part of your regime.
Remember that your exercise in the fresh air j ,

	<text>EXERCISES TO KEEP THE FEET WARM
M"^^ ANY women in winter suffer habitually
from cold feet.
■pets This is not a vulgar slangism, if you
luaßsl I please, but an undesirable physical
condition, known also to men.
Nine times out of ten women so af
flicted hold sedentary positions, where there is
little chance for exercise, and as the average wo
man is too tired at night to walk a dozen squares
after dinner, she goes to bed with cold extremi
ties.
All the inner Roles, woolen hosiery nnd pee

temporary relief.
The only way to effect its cure is to Ect right
down to the seat of the trouble, to improper cir
culation, the bane of ho many women's troubles.
Besides the acute annoyance of having cold feet
this condition indicates that you ore not in good
health, that your constitution has become weak
ened, that your heart is none too strong and that
in consequence tlm circulation is languid.
And what some women would consider the
"unkindest cut of all," i* that a clear, unblem
ished complexion is absolutely impossible with a
sluggish circulation.

EXERCISE 111.
Women who are afflicted with any organic dis
ease, especially heart trouble, should only take
up the following exercise under the supervision j
of a physical culture teacher or doctor.
Take correct position, heels together, toes'
apart, hands on hips. Take a full deep breath.

untruthful, aud one whom it 1» impossible to

out in front, then right. Repeat exercise without
allowing the herl.« to reneh the floor. Hold the
breath for a second, expel. Continue the motion
Until you fen] tired, rest, and resume it.
EXERCISK IV.
Place both hands over the head, locking the
thumbs together. Take a deep breath, rsieiug
your chest hign, and walk about yoxir room on
tiptoe; hold the breath for a few neconds, eipel,
take another, hold, expel; and bo walk about the
apartment until you are quite tired. Be sure to
keep your arms stretched high above your head.
When it '« possible to do thia exercise during
the day besides morning and night, so much the
better.
EXERCISE V.
Lie on the floor or on a very hard couch; for
in this exercise there must be no yielding under
the body. Take a deep inhalation through the
nose, raising the abdomen as you do so. Then
still holding the breath, force the chest upwards,
letting the abdomen down. Repeat movements,
and exhale through your nose while the chest is
raised. Practice until capable of doing move
ments five times without letting your breath out,
abdomen nnd chest up alternately.
EXERCISE VI.
Here ia another good exercise taken ■'- recum
bent position, lie on the floor, take a deep
breath, raißO the abdomen and feet without bend
ing tbe knees. When they are nearly perpendic
ular, bend knees and move limbs as though mov
you with a lofty bearing, the left hand usually
carried at the tide, fingerb gently cloiing, while
the right hand is carried across the abdomen, the
palm side generally facing upward. This ielU ot

There is considerable work attached to these
exercises and some may be considered vigorous;
but they will certainly do the work for you if
faithfully followed.

	<text>EXERCISE FOR GIRLS
T* I IIERK is no disputing the fact that
girls need exercise as much as boys,
— . and the day has long gone by when
I a frail, delicate, white-faced girl
was regarded as being a model of
femininity.
Girls are no longer afraid of being strong
and ruddy They are beginning to thoroughly
understand that good health is not the pre
rogative of one sex, and that good health can
only Be preserved by exercise.
It is true that all girls cannot exercise as
they should. Some are so situated that ev
ery hour from sunrise to sunset has its duties,
each one confining; others inherit ailments
that prevent walking or running, and a few
perhaps are restrained by false ideas oi
dtcorum from developing their frames by ex
ercise. But the majority remain in a state
of ill health simply because they will not ex
ercise, or do not know how to set about it.
Perhaps many do not know what exercise
really is. A carriage ride is not exercise,

upon the rocks, content only to breathe, be
reft of all power to think or feel.
Of course, the faintness soon passed, and
once more, as I opened my eyes and sat up,
the torture of thinking began.
I could not forget poor Holly, and the de

forever haunted m: all through that lonely
night.
What my thoughts and feelings were as 1
sat there, hour after hour, iv my dread isola

haps I may safely leave them to the readers

One paramount fear kept me sleepless ana
alert. It was the dread that father mignt
undertake to follow me on a raft, and, less
fortunate than I. miss the island and be car

Long before the day dawned the strain ot
this anxiety had become nearly insupportable,
and the incessant roaring of the mad waters
seemed to have started an echo in my brain
that was driving me wild.
How I welcomed the first faint streak of
gray light in the east, though the dawn was
ushered in by a cold breeze blowing up
stream that chilled me in my wet clothing
through and through; but daylight, I thought,
must surely bring me relief in some shape.
So, with chattering teeth, I sat motionless,
with' my eyes fixed on th^ western bank of
the stream, watching and waiting. I knew
the noise of the waters would prevent me
hearing a voice if I were hailed, hence I must
trust to my eyes to discern my rescuers.
I had sat thus for perhaps an hour after
the first peep of day, and the sky in the east
was beginning to take on a tinge of palest
pink, when I was startled by the striking of
some hard substance on the rock beside me.
Turning quickly, I beheld, lyins within two
feet of me, an Indian arrow, tipped with a
spear and winged with bright feathers.
Springing to my feet, I faced about to scan

Gymnastics are not always exercise in the
true sense. No pennnncnt good can come of
¦winging clubs or dumb bells in a close
room, unless followed by a brisk walk and
a bath. Croquet is exercise, and lawn tennis
is best of all. But. neither •of these games
is beneficial if played for fashion's sake.

the spectators, might as . well be reading a

Mowing is another capita] exercise for girls,
if they can overcome their natural timidity;
and swimming is better sitll. It is not gen
erally known that girls swim more gracefully
than boys and learn quicker. Both these ex
ercises have an additional value in the fact
'that they may some time preserve life.

The spectacle tent a despairing chill to my
heart. Of course, they were hostiles, 1 (old
myself, for had they not tried to shoot me in
the most cowardly- way, before ] saw them?
I stood stock still and gazed at them.
Presently they drew off together, as if in
consultation, then one of them ran off, out of
sight, only to return in a little while, bearing
a coil of rawhide rope.
To one end of the ropo they tied an oblong
stone weighing three or four pounds. One of
the Indians thjn swung it several times
around his head, and, with a whiz throiMjli
the air, it shot over me and fell in the water
on the opposite side of the island, thus leav
ing a line stretched taut from shore to island.
His next move was to slacken the lin3 and
proceed to fasten the end of it to a tree on
the bank, and while thus occupied, he and his
companions united in making tiigns to me to
do likewise with my end of the rope.
I very soon understood their meaning, and
comprehended something of Uieir plan to gain
possession of me; but, with a child's inbred
terror of the red men of the plains, I felt
that such a rescue would be scarcely prefera
ble to death. So I folded my arms and shook
my head in refusal.
They did not seem to rightly interpret my
attitude and evidently thought they had not
succeeded in making their meaning clear to
me, and their gesticulations became each mo
ment more excited and vehement.
Finally, growing tired of this game of cross
purposes I thought of a way to make them
aware of my sentiment, and, though quakiug
with fear of possible results, I proceeded to
put the plan in execution.
In my pocket I carried a knife— not a lady's
penknife, but a Btout, bone-handled "Barlow,"
such as boys affected a quarter of a century
ago. I drew it forth, and, bending down, de
liberately cut the rope, strand by strand,
while the Indians watched my movements in
a puzzled way. But when 1 caught up the
severed rope and tossed it out into the stream,
their demeanor underwent a sudden and start
ling change, and I saw that my ac,t had en
raged them.
Seizing their bows, thsy began shooting ar

Where good roads abound, cycling is an
exercise timt is beneficial, if not carried to
excess. No girl should attempt to ride more
than twenty miles a day: to ride more is re
ducing exercise to work. It is injurious to
try to pee how far or fast you can go in a
given time. Take it moderately and you will
?ever tire of your wheel.
Lastly comes walking, and I think that is
the ben( exercise of all. •It is the simplest
of all exercises, yet there are some rules to
be observed if you would get the greatest
bnefit. The best time to walk is before nine
in the morning or after five in the after
noon. Begin with a mile walk every morn
ing or evening and increase the length until
you can cover ten miles a day?
Walk in the country if possible; if that is
impracticable, choose wide streets, those nneci
with trees preferred. Mind how you walk.
Square your shoulders, expand your chest,
and hold your head high. Keep the mouth
closed when not talking, and breathe through
the nose. Step out easily and firmly, letting
the ball of the foot strike the ground first.
Vary the location of the walk each day if
possible, and exercise the ere and mind as
rows at me. This was the result I had appre
hended, and as the ugly missiles fell around
me, I sprang to the side of the island farthest
from my assailants and dropped into a little
chasm I had previously noticed between two
Kicks, quite close to the spot at which I had
first crawled ashore.
I had hoped to be able to conceal myself
from their view; but, to my dismay, I found
that the aperture was not deep enough, md,
crouch as I might, mv h;ad still protruded
above the surface of the rocks, a conspicuous
target for arrows.
Casting a despairing glance around for some
means of protecing that highly-valued portion
of 'my anatomy, my eyes fell on the old cedar
bucket, htill dangling from the sharp, dead
snag on which it had so opportunely impaled
its-elf.
It was scarcely. three feet from the edge of
the island, and, acting upon what I have ever
insisted upon regarding as an inspiration, I
arose, leaned, far over, resting my weight on
the projecting snag, and dislodged the pail.
Then, springing back into the chasm, I
crouched low and drew the inverted bucket
(\er my head, holding it firmly in place by
the bail.
Up to that moment I had heard no sound
from the Indians, though, during their ani
mated pantomime, I thought I saw their lips
moving and imagined they were trying to
make their voices heard; but nature's counter
tone had rendered the effort futile. Now,
however, shrill and distinct above the roar of
the fall, arose a prolonged yell of strident
laughter, proving, I think, that there is in
the savage breast a sense o.f humor before
which even his anger melts away.
Imprisoned in my wooden helmet, I had no
loophole of observation, and when some min
utes had gone by without further sound or
d?monstration from the enemy, I began to
grow- restless in my cramped position, and,
lifting the bucket a little to peep out, I dis
covered, with surprise and relief, that the
Indians had disappeared.
Aft:>r waiting and watching a while longer,
seeing no sign of them, I finally crept from
my hiding place, and seating myself on the
faithful bucket, with my back toward the fall,
I prepared to divide my attention as impar
tially as possible between the two shores of
the stream, dreading lest either my foes or
my friends should appear and be unseen by
me.
By that time ths sun had risen above the
well as the body. Never let the walk become
a drudgery.
When you return home take a Rponge bath,
a vigorous rubbing, a cool gown, a glass of
milk and a nap. If you do not feel healthy,
happy and wise after a month of this exer
cise, you may be sure that yoii have some
chronic disease.
In summing up, remember that all exer
cise, to be beneficial, must be taken in the
open air. You may amuse yourself over a
billiard table or a game of cards, or you may
have a lovely time in a ball room, but you
cannpt develop your form or add an ounce to
your weight unless you breathe fresh air.
The simplest exercise in the open air will do
you more good than the most elaborate gym
naßtics"in a closed room.
You must also bear \p mind that exercise
must be continuous to be beneficial. Once
you get yourself in good condition, you must
keep there by constant exercise.
Do not look upon this as a task: with in
creaaing strength the exercise will be a posi
tive pleasure, which you will not think of
shirking. You will be proud of your ability,
arid your ambition will grow with your
achievements. Try it for one year, and see
if I am not a true prophet.</text>

	<text>Open Air Exercise to Give the Arms Strength and Grace.
T
WIS ft the third of a tcrie$ of practical lenson on health
and grace especially prepared for thia newtpaptr . by
Ui$ Christain Hitler, F. C. ., the famout Englith health
expert.
By F. Christian Miller, F. C. I.
WE EngllKh have an expres
sive little word of three
letters to describe that
state In which we are entirely well.
It la "fit." When we are "fit" we
are equal to anything that may hap
pen. 'Flt" la a cross-cut word to
adequate. .
When we. aie "At" we have an
eaay, comfortable, natural bearing.
' We have an alert mlrrd. Our spirits
are buoyant and that ' buoyancy
speaks in every movement and ges
ture, and particularly in the expres
sion of our faces.
; Now to be lit, what? First we
should begin the day well. A good
: beginning, the right beginning and
', the only beginning, is to take' two
. baths, an inward and an , outward
I one. I am always "fit," and this I
ascribe ln large-part to my lnv
. rlablo habit of the morning inward .
' bath. Aj eoon as I rise in the
I morning I-drink two glaues of
water. Cool, not ice water. If Jce
water Is brought to my-room I ro
1 move the lee before drinking It.
Water should not be too rapidly
drunk. Hotter quaff or sip it than
vulgarly toss it down at a gulp.
The inward bath should always be
followed by a douche. In England
this term means what I have heard
Americana call rplashlng. We take
our plunge bath, the cool or cold
tub, but do not (step out of It imme
diately after as you do here. In
stead, we sit or stand in the tub and
throw handfuls of water over our
neck, shoulders, back and breast.
Then, tingling from the shock of
the cold water, ive step from the
tub and, wrapping ourselves in a
huge bath towel, that is like a sheet
except that it is made of rough
towelling, we thoroughly dry our
uelves. Then we get. into our not too
tlg'ht clothing. It has been said,
and very reasonably, that our cloth
ing should be at least four sizes too
large so that the air can circulate
freely between the clothing and the
skin. The air skin needs ventila
tion. It gets none when we wear
our clothing hermetically tight The
lungs are willing slaves yet they
cannot do all the work of purifying
the blood. If the third lung, the
skin, neglects its duty the body bo
comes snaemlc. It In in nstnge of
starvation, the starvation for fresh
air.
To be "fit"- we must have fresh
air and plenty of It , We cannot
get too much of it, so we must get
as much a we can. Particularly
here where you live in too hot and
steam heated rooms you should fly
for your life to the outer air. And
you should reduce the temperature
of your rooms. .American women
ask me the secret of the fine com
plexions of the Hnglloh women. I
answer, "fresh air and cool rooms."
I believe that the temperature of a
living room should never be above
sixty. In a sleeping chamber it
may well drop ten or twenty degrees
below. I . sleep In a bedroom at
fifty degrees, sometimes forty.
There is much to be said in favor
of sleeping out of doors, if you grad
ually accustom yourself to it Bum
mer i the time to begin, so that the
body will not be too greatly shocked
by the change of surroundings. The
habit of xlinlng on the veranda or
balcony of your home as long as tho
weather will permit is excellent. If
I lived In New York where there are
few yards and many roofs, I should
plcnick a great deal on the roofs,
eating many a simple meal above the
roar of the city streets. This could
be frequently done for six or seven
months of the year, I should say.
And at any time of the year I should
be inclined to go often to the roof
for my deep breathing exercises, for
the air, while colder there, is per
haps 60 per cent purer.
Every woman should allow herself
at least two hours a day out of doors,
one hour in the morning and one in
the afternoon. Or if her circum
stances will only permit one hour a
day, let it be divided into two equal
parts, one In the morning and one
in the afternoon. Try to get your
exercise period Into the sunlit
hours. Walk briskly during the
hours out of doors. Or play briskly
at whatever you are doing. I ap

chests and undeveloped arms could
improve their looks greatly by means
of this exercise. Every woman loves
a round, full neck and a plump,"

and the hollows filled in witli
hard, firm flesh.
The punching bag will accomplish
this for the most frail person in the
world if she will only exercise con

it It rounds the arms, giving' those
alluring dimples at the elbows, along
with a good shoulder deevlopment.
Miss Patterson entertains a num

bag with a vim that makes its clatter
against the platform sound like volley-firing
in a Mexican battle.
"I wear 4-ounce gloves," she says,
"to protect my hands. Striking with
lighter gloves would, in time, enlarge
the hands, and this, for a lady, you

of all 13 swimming, because it
develops all the muscles, and
makes one exercise one's
brain at the same time.
Now, I shouldn't say that
housework and swimming
alone arr. responsible for my
good health. My summers in
the country include work in
' the field besides. My sisters
and I take caro of the garden,
pick apples and rake hay, and
keep the lawn in good shape.
After we finish with the
housework, we work for a
couple of hours every morn
ing in the garden or on tho
lawn. We have our dinner
at noon, and then, after the
dishes are put away, if we
have any more out-door work
to do, we finish it, and tnen
we are ready to amuse ourselves.
It is only people who are not used to exercise
who do not like farm work because it makes them
tired.
If one is used to using one's muscles in swim
ming or in playing tennis or basket ball, ono
doesn't get tired so easily working in the garden.
Hoeing and rakin and weeding are all good ex
ercise, and it's lota of fun to watch the things
prow. We love it, and so we don't mind it.
Two or three time a week, after supper, wo
walk to tiie village, about a mile away, and some
times besides going there for the mail, we attend

one'is used to it, it makes all the difference in the
world.
All the year round we get up at C o cIock, with
the exception of Sundays, when we have an extra
hour cf rest. I know many people complain of

Shank's Marc Her Vehicle
During the winter, while going to school, I get
plenty of exercise in the kitchen, in the school
gymnasium, by attending some dances and skat
ing, and of course walking a lot every day. I
think I average Irom four to six miles every day.
My sisters and I never think of taking a car to
do shopping or any other errands we havo to do.
We always walk. It is much more pleasant than
being packed in vile smelling subway trains and
unclean germ-laden trolicy card.
Naturally, a girl docs not get as pleasant ex
ercise during tho season in town that sho would
get in tlv country in summer, but it i3 most Im
portant that every girl should have some kind of
vigorous exercise the year round, particularly In
the open, air.
Boor circulation will make a girl pale and
delicate looking. Lack cf fresh air will make her
lose her appetite. Vigorous exeicise in the open
will stimulate her circulition and give her an ap
petite for good, wholesome food instead of for
tweet tilings and tea and toast. My mother has
alvny.--. been most particular about having U3 eat
pood, wcil-co'.kp.i food, three times a day, with
very few ;veet things.
Ho-.vevcr, I cat a rather light breakfast
never coffee or tea I don't care for either. For
breakfast, I drink milk, and eat some fruit and
perhaps ;;n epp or two. Tr.en I carry my lunch
sc loo:, ann eat a hearty dinner in the evening,

One thing we do the year round is to sleep
with windows wide open, no matter what the tem
perature may he. Fr?3h air is one of the most
important things to remember if one wishes to
have good health. I never Fit in a closed room if
I can help it. If one is in good health, if one's'
circulation is unimpaired, one doe3 not feel tha
need of such a great amount of steam heat. I
have Leen in homes when the heat was sufficient
to give one a Turkish bath. People who live in
tnat temperature can never be well and strong.

Even if a girl is employed during the day, ahe
can v.-nh: from her werk in the evening, or Bha
can take a walk, or spend an hour or two skatinr
or dancing after the evening meal. She will sleep
til the better for this exercise, and feel much
more rested tho next day. .She should never ahirk
the kitchen.
People who wake up tired are either gufTer
lng from poor circulation or lack of enough frtih
air in their room during the night.</text>

	<text>Rovival of Rollor Skating
Forty or fifty roller skating
rinks have been built and opened
to the public in New England
New Jersey and other states with 1
in the year All are well patron
ized and their promoters believe
that this sport neglected for 20
years will again become popular
In the late 70s and early 80s roll
er skating almost attained the dig
nity of a national amusement No
person was too oldior too young
to use the rinks The hockey
games endurance races and exhi
bitions of fancy skating arranged
bv rink owners attracted big aud
iences for four or five years be
fore the popular appetite was sat
isfied
Then and almost in a moment
roller skating fell into disfavor
Only children clung to it and on
them it has never lost its hold
This sudden loss of popularity
was due simply to the fact that
the pastime was worked to death
for although a good many harsh
charges were made by solemn
moralists against it these never
could have killed it Now it is re
turning as a novelty with another
gene ration of pleasurcscekers to
appeal to but it is improbable
that it will ever regain the glory
it once had The outofdoors
cult has made great progress since
1885 and roller skating is an in
door game</text>

	<text>A Roller Skating Rink
Will Open March
Third,
It has been a long time coming,
many have thought, but it has arrived.
At least the preliminaries havo been
arranged for inaugurating tho "roller
skating craze" in Honolulu,
The Honolulu Skating Ilink Com
pany hag been organized bv a number
of young men. of whom Clifford Kim
ball is the business representative. A
skating boom has been in tho air for
somo timo and this ontcrpriso is its
culmination,
Having taken the Union Feed Co.'s
old warehouse at (jucen and Edinburgh
streets for u rink, tho company
will open it to the public on Saturday
evening, March 3. Lumber is already
on tho ground for tho skating floor. A
supply of skates is on tho wny. They
are or steel with ball bearings in fact
the type of skate in uso on the Coast
and in the roller skating rinks of New
York and Boston. On tho inauka siilo
of the building tho walls are to be
opened up for admitting the cool
breezes. This will make for comfort
in tho exhilarating sport. A lean-to on
tho Waikiki sido will bo fitted up. as a
ftr.injlaf nnrl. aiu uvMrtfofn.. fliAvn a
"Slsofjto be' a jiodnwator booth on the
premises, but ,no spirituous, malt or a
vinous liquor will bo sold. Arc lights
will bo -installed, which will make the
rink always brilliant.
Of course an admission feo will be
charged, as well as a skating feo. The
riuk will be run on a first-class basis,
in ehnrgo of a competent man. It is
believed by the promoters that tho
time for starling bucu a place of amusement
is opportune. For a long period
there has been' a dearth of popular entertainment
other than theatricals and
field Bports.
To tho younger generation of Honolulu
folks up to twenty-five years of
age skating will ba an absolute novelty,
for it is twenty years since tho
previous voguo of that amusement
here. And thero Is undoubtedly a
larger population of tlnW hankering
after that class of diversion, combining"
exorcise with rollicking fun, In Honolulu
now than then.
The craze will bo a pastimo, moreover,
for ninny onlookers of tho large
class who take enjoyment from seeing
others making joyful. At suitable intervals
there will bo masked or fancy
dress carnivals held for tho jollification
of tho town. In the former craze
theso wero highly successful features,
No doubt Bandmaster Bcrgcr will meet

	<text>TABLE TENNIS.
HI'LKS OF TLAY FOR THE NKW INIM>OR
GAME. AI^SO CALLED POMPOM."
Table tennis is the name of a new game which
was introduced in England a short time ago.
and has already become one of the most popu
lar of indoor amusements. It is the came
of lawn tennis in miniature, played on an or
dinary dining table. The net is a tiny one, made
of gauxe stretched between two uprights, which
rest on a bar laid across the table. The balls
are made of the thinnest kind of pyroxyline ma
terial, and are consequently very light. The
racquet has a slender handle and a blade with
a frame about one-half inch thick, which Is cov
ered on both sides with thin drumhead Material.
The play and counting are practically the satn<?
as in lawn tennis, but, according to the rules,
'•the player serving must not put his racquet
over the table nor have it above his wrist." That
is, he must serve underhand and never over
hand, but after service he may hit the ball as he
likes, but he most not volley.
The contact of the light ball with the drum
head racquet produces a pleasant sound, and
because of this sound th(» game received the
name "pompom."
Among the rules for playing the game are the
following:
No faults are allowed: if a fault is served.
that is, the ball does not go over the net or goes
off the table without touching the opposite side
to the server, a |M>int is counted to the non
server.
If the net is touched by the l»all. and the ball
goes over, and otherwise the service is correct,
it is a let. and counU nothing to either side.
If a volley is taken a point is counted against
the person volleying.</text>

	<text>THE FIRST PING-PONG TOURNAMENT IN LONDON.
It wum held at thy Royal Aquarium In December. 
AN ABSORBING HEW INDOOR GAITS
WHICH HAS ATTAINED GREAT
POPULARITY IN LONDON;
The three men who occupied the studio flat
were having their quiet end-afternoon srnoks
together. There was the artist, w hose hair haj
turned gray after long years of painting an*
black and white doings; the youth who, fcesi
from art school, was just making a start, and
the man of business, who was the saving clause
of the combination. He put up the money wh»3
black and whites would not sell and the youths
checks from home were delayed In the mails.
"I wish people would find something new wia
which to entertain us, ' said the man of buij.
ness, in a bored tone.
"New Year is coming," chirped the youth, aa
obvious statement, setir.g that Christmas «xj
just one day past. "Perhaps Santa Claus tLpgti

There*! nothing new under the sun. Billy*

■ hurry."
Then there came a knock on the door, and a
messenger appeared with a dainty note. Billy
grasped it hastily. Billy was in love.
"It's addressed to all of us," he said, with di*.
appointment.
"All the more reason you should hurry up aaj
lead it,"' commanded the man of business.
"It's from Harriet," he murmured, as he read
it to himself.
"Head out loud, uli>.t"" commanded one of the
older men.
" "Won't you ccme up to-morrow night and
play ping-pong." " read Billy. "Now, what is
ping-pong?"
"Search me?" remarked the one who was nut
artistic, except when it came to making money.
"Sounds Chinese," said the artist.
"I've heard of 'pom-pom,' " remarked BiUy.
"That's a sort of big gun which makes a funny
noise." Billy had ence had the idea of beeoininj
a military man. "But ping-pon^r— that's a new
one on me."
"Some new style of bridge. I suppose." mut
tered the artist. "It's not for me. I've sacri
ficed enough on that altar."
"Well. I'm going up to play ping-pong," an
nounced the youth. "I don't care what it is, tit
name's new. Better come along. Jack. You
were growling a minute ago about there being
nothing new, and here you are."
Dilly went to Harriet's and played ping-pong,
and when he had not retumeO by midnight th«
other fellows knew that he was enjoying it. H«
would not tell them what the new game was
when he finally put in an appearance, but ad
vised them to find out for themselves.
An indoor edition of tennis is ping-pong, til*
name coming from the curious sound which tie
parchment rackets give forth when they striis
the little balls. It is played on the dining room
taMe, across the centre of which a low net is
stretched. Th> rules are almost the same as
in tennis, and the points are counted tennis
fashion. There is even mure chance for skilful
handling of the ball than In outduor game*
and there are tricks innumerable which add
interest and variety. Skilful players can ii??
up the volleying process until interest reaches
fever pitch. It is almost as exciting for tie
spectators as for the players, which U core
than can be said of tennis.
It is an absorbing game, as the EngHsh S«l
tell you. It his been played i:i London ilisisj
romis for the last two or three years; but ha
never been strictly in vogue until this winter
The ollieers of the British army carried pir.g
peng sets to South Africa with t'.u-m. and have .
set up their tab) on tho wldt when the Ecea
let them remain Ln camp long enough.
Why the game has not taken hold in tiia '•
country is something which Americans who live
In London cannot understand. They have writ
ten home about the beauties and delisht3 o! v
ping-pong. They laud it to the skies for tie
exercise it affords to busy c.tn who have o
work in offices all day. and to women who **

	<text>From present indications society will
no longer be divided upon the lines of
birth, l)i ceding or wealth, but the quail-
Jiciition for membership in the innermost
circle will )m- ability to play "ping pong,"
that fascinating parlor game that has
recently come over the seas to us from
aristocratic London.
Age. sex. color or previous condition
inaki no difference with the devotees of
the game and in England duchesses have
been known to struggle for the honor of
having a champion ping pong player from
some suburb at their receptions. Success
ful authors, artists and actors are no
longer being: lionized and made to roar
for the benefit of society. Their place ,s
but secondary now to the man who can
make the highest score with the bellum
covered racquet* and the celluloid balls.
The craze has but just struck the West,
although in New York, and. in fact, in
all of the Eastern cities, it is raging al
most as widely as it does in England.
The dealers say they are unable to keep
up with the demand for the game and
that thousands of sets have been sold,
v.ith the demand still increasing. "Pins
pong" parties are taking the place of
bridge whist and cinch contests and even
of bowline tournaments. No longer does
the Western swain sit contentedly in the
parlor with the girl of his heart, discuss
ing the weather undisturbed by the other
members of the family. Now the parlor
is in use. Father and mother and the
neighbors are "serving" and "returning"'
and calling love 15, love 30, deuce ad
vantage, etc.
i'iiiK pong is Bimply modified tennis
played upon a ta-ble in the houft« instead
of a court in the open air and is, in fact,
table tennis. Bui when the little celluloid
ball strikes the hard surface of a table
the contact prodapes a sound best
d< scribed by the word "ping" and as it
bounds against the viium racquet the
Bound "pong," a full note lower, issues.
Some person with a quick ear and a
quicker imagination translated these
sounds and the gamfe was christened with
the catchy name "ping pong," a name
tnat has helped to call attention to it.
The balls are very light, much like blown
birds' iggs to the touch, and there is no
possibility of their breaking or of injur
ing anything they may strike except, of i
course, fragile bric-a-brac. The racquets !
are light rattan affairs, covered with |
vellum. In this respect they differ from j
those used in ordinary tennis, although |
ih>- dealers are showing some specially
constructed ones strung with catgut, as j
are tennis racquets. They were ordered
by ]>ing pong players' who are also tenn:s
experts and who believe they can play
In tter with the strung racquets than with
the vellunf-covered ones. Any table
about the height of a billiard table and
jn the neighborhood o. nine feet long by
five feet wide will do for the game. Many
use dining tables. To be correct one
should have a table, the surface of which
has been painted dark green, or covered
With biliard cloth, it makes no difference
in the game whether it is played with or
Without a cloth upon the table. Without
a cloth the balls will, of course, bounce
higher. The game is played by two or
Jour persons, usually by two. For the
at in which thfe are two players,
and this is the game in high favor, each
player stands art one end of the table.
The one first delivering the ball is called
the "serve;;" t):.- other person is th-e
".■strikeout." At the end of the iirst game
the "strikeout"-becomes the "server' and'
00 on alternately to the end of the sets.
As soon as theball is served and drops
nnywlK re on the table top beyond the t.et
it is 'play." if it drops Into the net-or
off the table it counts to the "strike out."
I i re is no second service as in lawn ten
jus. On either player winning the first
strike, the score is called fifteen for that
fourth stroke won by either player is sac
ond "game," unless both players have
yon three strikes, "forty all," whsn the
scon- is called deuce, and the next stroke
v.on by either player is scored "advan
tage" to that player.
[f the same player wins the next stroke
the game Is his: If he loses the next
eiroke the score is again deuce, and so i
on until either player wins the two
Strokes imediately following the score
player; on either player winning his or
her second stroke, the score for that play
er is thiity. On either player winning- the |
third stroke, the score is forty, and the
of deuce, and the "game" is scored for
that player. The player who lirst wins
six games wins the set. In tourna
ments usually three sets are played by
each competitor against each other one.
The rules for playing are similar to
those in lawn teunis, except that no over
hnnd service is allowed. There are no
urts marked as in lawn tennis, the
~\i of the table forming the court, so
that the ball striking any part of the ta
ble is in play. The strokes, apart from
the service, are divided into two main
lasses—the half volley and all other
Etrokee. The half volley is when the bull
immediately after striking the
table. The player hits where he thinks
the ball will be, not at the ball itself,
and it is, therefore, almost impossible
to actually hit is half voiieyin^. Ji is the
ball which hits the racket, and not the
racket that hits the ball. This ia en
tirely defensive play. To attack, the
ball must be struck after it has reached
the top of the bound, or even later, for on
ly then has the player complete control of
the ball. When the ball bounds high it
may be smashed straight on the table,
but if your opponent gets back so as to
make the return, twist your wrist BO that
the ball is hit at right angles to the
flight or even somewhat underneath; it
will drop close to the net and come
straight up or even bounce back over the
net. An effective stroke in reply to a
hard (irive is that called the "crouch
smash." As the ball cornea toward you,
crouch down and hit It at the edge of the
table. This is a good return for a hard
service, but it is most difficult to ac
complish. All these strokes can be done
■backhanded— -in fact, some are such
easier, as, owing to the wrist having
more play in the proper direction, a (,-rtat
er twist can be imparted to the ball.
In addition a ball falling on the right
hand side»f the table can be driven with
the back of the hand in any d-esircu di
rection. This stroke should only Le used
when pressed by a hird ball.
It will be gathered from th<^ strokes
described that play can be made both
back and forehand. This gives many
more opportunities for deceiving an op
ponent. Variety is the secret of success.
Nev< r let your opponent anticipate your
intention. When driven to swing, after
hitting the ball, do not stop and turn
back, but continue the swing the same
way, bo as to make a complete circle.
The player i an get square with the table
much quicker by doing this. Ping pong
sets may be had to suit any fancy or any</text>

Special Correspondence of The Republic
Now York, May 16 There seems to be pi
most no limit to the. number of breaks and
bruises a man may suffer and still live to
tell the tale. As long as no -vital organ la
actually destrojed, there seems to be al
most no end to tho Injuries a. man may re
ceive without their proving mortal.
Two workmen in New Jersej have reccntly
been all but broken to pieces, but still live.
One of them, a miner, fell down a 200-foot
shaft near Morrlstown, sustaining injuries
which will keep the doctors busy for sev
eral months. The other received an ener
getic kicking from a mule, and will so
about for the rest of his life with a con
siderable part of his anatomy composed of
silver plates, rubber and falsa skin.
It Is difficult to say which of the eraser is
the mora rem" Me. William C Lloid of
Trenton, N. discharged from the
hospital onlj i days ago, after three
months of tr&, .t. Ills injuries were in
flicted by a mug In tho fraction of a sec
ond. The animal kicked off large sections
of his skin, fractured his skull, removed
his eyebrows and practically all of his
teeth, besides giving him a general shaking
up. To-day, however, he is practically as
good as now, and e-tpecte. soon to return to
his work. Meanwhile, his head will re
main, as long as he lives, a veritable mu
seum of artificial appliances.
Llojd was employed in the stables of the
Rocbllng Company, and was know n to be a
daring and expert horseman. The com
pany owned a very unruly mule, which had
long resisted all the attempts made to tamo
him. and tho perilous work was finally In
trusted to Lloyd. Unfortunately, tho at
tempt was made without any witnesses
present. There is, therefore, no authentic
record of what happened.
Tho unfortunate mule tamer was deprived
of all consciousness very early in the en
gagement. He remembers being kicked
twice. Judging from his appearance after
tho engagement, it appeared that tho mule
had ppent tho greater part of tha day kick
ing him.
Tho blows wero delivered fairly In the
face. Tho force of their delivery may bo
Imagined from the fact that several of the
heaviest bones of the tkull were actually
splintered by the impact. Llojd is pos
sessed of Immense energy, or ho could not
hav o lived an hour. As a matter of fact, the
real extent of the Injuries was not dUcov
ered for some time.
Lloyd was first treated in Trenton, but
when the extent of his injuries became
knowr it was found necessary to take him
to "jpeciilists In Philadelphia. Tho work ot
rebuilding his skull and remaking his face
a lot to tho game besides tho name; and
you may call it with perfect propriety, "ta
ble tennis." That will save your feelings.
Tor tho game is nothing moro or less
than a diminutive gamo of tennis It is
counted exactly like tennis; requires as
many players; furnishes as much exercise,
and offers as great an opportunity for tho
practice of subtle heart-charms.
Who plays ping-pong? The answer is
easy: Kverybody. The popularity- of tho
gamo has increased so much in tho last
few months that it has become necessary
to manufacture the racquets and balls in
St. Louis; tho foreign markets are unablo
to furnish even half of what Is required
It is not only a fad, but has undoubtedly
como to stay as much as tennis did years
ago
Tennis is still a popular game. We have
champions; national and local. So It will
bo with ping-pong before another year has
rolled around. Already In St Louis me
have tournaments, championships and
prizes at ping-pong parties. There is great
rivalry between clubs and between mem
bers of clubs. One cannot go to dine now
adays without having to tako part in a
gamo of ping-pong after the dinner. It Is
everywhere and all-absorbing.
Not only men of leisure and ladies of
quality aro indulging In it, hut business
men and college stoudents and women
mho have to busy themselves about a hun
dred and one things during the day. Hv-
erybody has the fever. A ping-pong parlor
on Locust street is crowded every day for
several hours with players and there Is no
sign of any loss of Interest In the game.
Bankers and brokers find that the gamo
gives them moro and better exercise in a
short time that they have been able to get
in any other way. Among the devotees of
the game are Allen West, Dwight Davis,
Harold Kauffman, Hunt Turner and Jim
Drummond. They frequently find tlmo to
meet during the day for a game. Usually
it Is for but a short time, but occaslonaily
they become so Interested that tfcey finish
the afternoon at the table.
But the season for ping-pong Is after
dinner. Then at private residences and at
the clubs there is Invariably a game In
progress. Special rooms have been fitted up
in houses large enough to accommodate
them, and In the clubhouses where the par
ticularly ardent worshippers at tho shrine
of the celluloid ball and the racquet may
commune with their own kind.
Stuart Stlckney, he of golf fame, is a
"fiend" at ping-pong. He says himself that
he has to struggle to keep away from a table
during tho day In order that he may devote
himself to business. But at night and on
Saturdays he gives may to th desire and
Instead of playing golf he stands at a ping
pong table until he is about ready to drop.
The exercise In the game will be ac
knowledged when It Is known that a tennis
and a golf champion have almost forsaken
their favorite game for the enticing ping
pong. Dwight Davis does not play tennis
as much as he used to; and Stuart Stlckney
is rarely seen with his clubs Yet. both ex
celled in their special branches of athletic.
But ping-pong is a winter game, said one
who was only half converted. Needless to
say he could play only fairly. A host rose
to contradict him. Already many lawns are
being prepared for a table during the um
mer. All that is necesasry 1 an even place I
for the table and light enough so that the'
balls may be seen In the evening. In Japan 1
and in England the game Is played the year
'round. Why not In St. Louis?
Evening ping-pong parties during the
summer are already assured. It Is not dis

Tho lost teeth were repl icpd by a full new
double set. Meanwhile a number of small
fractures of bones of the head were set and
held in position until they had knitted in
the ordinary manner
The most remarkable part of the opera
tion of repairing the damages inll'cted by
th mule was the operation of si-in grafting.
Friends volunteered to supply him with a
small part o the'r own cuticle to rep'aco
that which had been removed by the mule.
Tho operation is rather delicate and is pain
ful for both parties, c.
The contributors presented themselves at
the hospital, to be prepared for the opera
tion. The skin was taken from the upper
rart of the forearm. The skin was first
carefullv shaved and next washed very
thoroughly with a strong antiseptic. Kvcry
precaution was of course taken to prevent
any contagion All tho instruments used
were steriljied.
The other case was that of a miner named
Peter Henshaw of Hibernia, N. J. Hen
sham's Injuries were not so nany or pic
turesque as Lloyd's, though the accident
itself w as cv en more remarkable. Hensham
was working the other day near the top of
a W-foot telegraph pole when he lost hla
hold, and plunged downward. He was near
ly 00 feet from the ground when he lost
hold, and the fall, to thoe who chanced
to sec him, appeared to mean certain death.
As he dropped, however, he reached -6ut
mildly, and by a lucky chance his arm
struck a set of telegraph wires beneath
him, and to one side These served to part- ,
ly check his fall, but at the same time
swung his body outward. Ho fell from tho
pole with an awful force.
AH this v as bad enough, but morse await,
ed him. The wires, bysinging him to
ono side, dropped him at tho foot of a
mining shaft. Tho mountains thereabouts
are honey -combed with these shafts, which.
pierce the earth at a variety of angles. The
shaft near which Henshaw fell runs into
a mountain at a steep angle. Had it been i
a perpendicular shaft he would have fallen i
to cc-tain death.
As it mas, he mas so badly stunned at
the Instant he struck tho ground that h
could not save himself, and slipped Into
the hole. His body continued to slip, slida
nrd fall by turns until it reached the bot.
torn of the shaft, 100 feet below. By a
miracle of good luck. Henshaw only hroke
one leg and two ribs In the descent.
tinctly a rich man's or woman's game, ai
has often been sapposed. but almost every
one may havo a set Tha sets aro cheap
even as compired with tennis sets. Wher
ever there is room for a dining table therfj
is room for ping-pong, and tho fascination
that the gamo nor. holds, especially amon
tho smart set. cannot bo downed by warn;
m cather.
Among tho particularly pood plng-ponr;
rooms in bt, Louis, asldo from tho clubs,
are those at tho Drummond's. Mis Wtck
him's and at tho McKittrick's. Cvery evo
ning ping-pong holda sway. It is proper
nowadays for young ladies to take soma
form of physical exercise, and ping-ponB
combines all the pleasure that they- may
find in any exercise and affords all tha
sport of play. j
Ralph and Walter McKittrlck, Arthua
Shepley and Dan KIrby- are among the best
and most enthusiastic players In the city.
The Country Club and tho Florissant Club
are utterly crazed over tho game. At pres
ent It holds the trumps over all other
games, and from Indications it will be tha
popular game of the summer at both clubs.
Of course, this does not mean that tenn!
and golf and polo will not havo their de
votees, but ping-pong will bo tho most frequently-
played gamo of tho season.
The women of the city are us enthusias
tic .as the men-possibly more so. and they
havo their claims upon the attention of tho
men and their sports. Ping-pong looks and
sounds llko a game that does not requira
as much cndtiranco and strength as other11
spons anu tint is sid to bo tho reuson
that the women have taken It up. As t,
matter ot fact. It is as violent as nlmnst
any gamo th it Is popular with many peo
ple, but It seems so playful that tho weaker
be. have seized upon It.
It is a fact that one business man of this
c ty a man or more than usual corpulence-
has reduced his weight by forty pounds
playing ping-pong. And If the truth mi.ro
known, it is probably true tint several
women have been enabled to become mora
sylph-like through the medium of the game.
But that Is .v matter concerning which
women will not talk.
Women who are onenlv .anient nl.-ners
of
ny
ping-pong are rot the ones of whom any
one can say they play to reduce thel
weight. They- are modern women In every
may, and have taken up tho game not only
because it Is tho fad, but also because it
Is a g ime that enables them to keep In
good physical condition It is proper no
longer for momtn to be weak and requiring
the attention of maids and menr but they
mut be able to cope with the strongest.
Accordingly, they tako as much exercise,
comparatively, as men And ping-pong of
fers them something in the way of a gam
that has not been offered by any thins
else.
Among the more prominent women play
ers of ping-pong are Mrs. James Drurr
mond, Mrs. William' Gregg, Mri. Laurence
J. Mornn MIs ickham. Mis Mitchell.
Mrs. E O. Stanard, Mrs. W. II. Walker
and Mrs. Goodman King. Each of theso
has an elaborate ping-pong room fitted up
nt her house, and parties are frequent. It
is not at nit unusual for them to meet in
the morning and play arduously befora
luncheon. It serves as an excellent appe
tizer. The game was hroiight 'to St. Louis by
two people at about the same time. Mrs.
E. H. Semple ot Westminster place be
came enamored of the game while abroad
last summer, and when she returned she
set up a table at once. Sirs. Sidney Walker
appeared on the scene at about the sama
time, an enthusiastic player of the game.
That mas its start In thi3 city. It did not
take long to bring the sport to its present
position, but these two St. Louisans havo
been instrumental In making it a fad.
One of the best players among the women
is Mrs. Lewis Haywood She has for sev
eral months been a devotee, and lias ac
quired remarkable 'kill in handling tho
racquet. Mrs. John Fowler Is another ex
cellent player, and Mrc Dan Taylor, Mrs,
Campbell Smith and Mrs. Frank HammeS
are also in the first class. </text>

Washington Entranced With

■ WASHINGTON, D. C. May 21.—Mover
j lias the national capital been so com-
T-letely enslaved by the fascinations of a
game, indoor or outdoor, as it has fallen
; (under the seductive influence of the won
jdc-rful new game, which, having set , all
J l^ngland crazy, has come with- a power
' to] stride across the Atlantic to exercise
its potent influence upon our social life.
i As a prominent leader of Washington
I society remarked the other day, "Wash
ington has fairly gone ping-pong mad."
. Conversation in capital society has now
i foe-come impregnated with the peculiar
I terms of the new pastime. Where for
merly one would hear "social precedence"
' and "rising man," one now hears "clever
i (half volleyer" and "invincible striker
I out." '
"Love" and "advantage" as topics of
; social conversation have now a ping-pong
significance entirely foreign to their for
xtx-r meaning among the capital gossips.
The ping-pong party has entirely sup
planted the whist party arid the bridge
circle.
The peculiar ping-pong of the celluloid
; balls as they are beaten to and fro (from
■which the game derives its name) is now
to be heard j in every Washington home
from the palatial mansion of the fam
-1 ily of the men who shape the nation's.
I destiny on Pennsylvania avenue to the
• humble residence of the congressional
I bootblack in the eastern section of the
i city. Years are a matter of no consid
; ©ration among the devotees of the sport.
■ The mature matron whose nod or frown
I Oias settled one way or the other the so
cial aspirations of mar.v- a newcomer
.at the capital is as frequently to be seen
i exerting herself in a manner wonderful
to behold, to keep the little swiftly pass- j
ing celluloid ball from dropping on her
I side of the net, as is the beautiful bud
| ding debutante who, with flushed face,
eyes sparkling with enthusiasm- and ex
. citement. and bared arms wildly but
Withal skillfully circling the air, is a
cSaily testimonial to the aethestic features
of the game.
Strike* nil Classes.
. . Nor are the enthusiasts of the new
gam" to be found only among the fairer
sex, - Washington masculinity has given
itself to ping-pong with an abandon
,Nor ar^ the enthusiasts .of the now
which would furnish a profitable study to
the seeker- of pysehologieal phenomena.
Staid congressmen, dignified senators.
Learned members of the bench and bar
When they meet together nowadays dis
cuss not, the political significance of the
lim.s. but the latest-make of ping-pong
racquet.
This -may be regarded as gross exagger
ation. It is a potent fact, however, that
ping p has attained a surprising vogue
■among Washington's public men.
All the leading hotels and cafes are
hastening to open up ping-pong parlors
on their premises, so that their distin
guished patrons may indulge .to their
heart's content in the game. . •
Senator Maur.a. when asked the other'
■day whether he favored the. erection of aj
ping-pong parlor in the national capital,
l>uckercd up.his brow* and gave the mat
tor a few minutes' serious consideration
before discussing the idea with a smile.
Congressman Sulzer, when asked to ex
plain the tremendous hold that ping-pong
has taken upon members of the-house,
said that it is a wonderful game for~ex
erclse. and gives one a good hand to
sustain the handshaking proclivities of
the vast army of well meaning citizens
| who swoop down upon unwilling repre
sentatives of the people with all the re
lentless energy of the notorious New
Jersey musquito upon its helpless victim.
As may be supposed, the stores have
not been slow to take advantage of the
commercial possibilities of the craze. In
* -addition to the fact that some of the
larger dry goods emporiums are opening
up ping-pong saloons for the accommo
dation of their patrons, the new game
has an important bearing upon the latest
styles. The ping-pong waist is prom
inently- displayed in the shop windows,
find is a phenomenal seller; while the
new forms of neckwear for women and
men bear handsomely embroidered figure.*
■of ping-pong racquets and balls upon
their silken folds.
Doom of the Tight Corset.
One important reform the game prom,
ises to effect, which may render rational,
the development which has been lavished'
upon it by England and America and im
mortalize the new game as one of the
most valuable and beneficent reform fac
tors of the century.
Ping-pong may abolish the tight laced
■corset.
Ping-pong is essentially an informal
game to be played at the spur of the
moment, as the whim seizes. It is a
game to be introduced by the smiling
hostess after the last vestige of the din
"■ner has been cleared away and ti;o
white table cloth is removed to make
way for the ping-pong net. Consequently
as the rapid movement and freedom of
body S necessary to me ping-pong player
renders the corset impossible, the charm
ing diner out has either to leave off her
corsets when she dresses to attend a
modern dim party or run the risk of
having to stand against the wall in ail
the-prim symmetry of a corseted waist
and, watch the merry movements of her
more fortunate sisters who, with grace
fully swing forms, keep the merry cellu
loid ball ping-ponging across the table
at a lively pace to the intense admira
tion of the man with the racquet on th^
other side of the table and .every other
man In the room. v
This good may ping-pong do; bu other
„ wise what peculiar qualities has the same
to '-rive it phenomenal popularity? Strict
ly speaking it is nothing more or less
then a table adaptation of lawn tennis
and tennis, while possessing to an equal
and even greater degree the same physi
cal benefits and sporting fascinations of
its replica has never attained the vogue
which has been vouchsafed to ping-pong.
Played on Dining Table.
Ping-pong is played on an ordinary din-
Ing table and its only accessories are
posts tp hold the net, the net itself
vellum string or wood-racquets and cellu- ■
loid balls: The game is for two people
one standing on one end of the table,
the other opposite. The player who first
delivers the ball is called the server ■ The
Other the striker out. i The service is
strictly underhand and is delivered from
beyond the end of the table.
£ The: ball served must drop on the table
beyond the net and is then in piav. if
it dops into the net or off the table it
counts to the striker out
The server wins a stroke if the striker
out fails to return the service or ball in
play of the table.
The striker out wins a stroke If the
server fails to return the ball in play or
makes a foul in service.
On either player winning his first stroke
the score la 15. The second stroke brings
the score to 30; the third stroke is called
•40 and the fourth stroke wins a game
The player who wins the first six games
' -wins a set.- -
This is all there really is to the game
of ping-pong. Certainly it Is a skill de
manding and skill acquiring game. It
lias simplicity and cheapness to recom
mend it. It is far better from a hygenie
standpoint than a majority of parlor
prames and is an extremely socialble and
interesting pastime. It is. for these rea
. sons and its similarity to tennis, a game
calculated to prove attractive to the"
. younger members of both sexes. .
: But why It has set the people of two
' countries almost crazy: why old as well
as young-have taken up ping-pong when
they would not as much as look at an-
other form of sport; why the game
acquired such a vogue on the other side
that one serious British magazine writer
has accused; English society of being
more interested in the records of ping- j
pong champion than in the fortune of
the British troops in South Africa and
has prophetically croaked of Nero fid
dling, while Rome is burning— are
phenomena that: it would puzzle the
average human being to account for; and
the answer is certainly not forthcoming
from the devotees of the game. : .

would be better if it were gray, but ex.- i
pcrience has taught that white is the best
adapted for the use of the expert player.
'•There can be no doubt," said an ex
pert the other day, "that the constant
watching- of the ball which is required in
the game tends to aggravate a^eakneaw
of the eyes. The moving of the muscUf
which control the eye3 wearies them after
an ordinary game. The control of. the
eyes is really the most essential part, for
the game calis into requisition compara
tively few muscles.
"I have heard much of the ping-pong
ankle, but as the ankle is used compara
tively little in playing I do not think that
the maiaUy is one.v/hich the player need
count. Some players find that the dorsal
muscles arc easily tired, and the man
who stoops a great deal in his effort to
find the balls which have been knocked to
the carpet is lijtcly to suffer from sore
ness and inflammation of the muscles
alrout the pftins. There is in my opinion
j. ping-pong eye, although I deny that
there is si ping-pong face.
"It has been said that the muscles of
the legs and arms are often wearied By
the game. This .is true in a. sense, but I
think that the eye and the brain -will be
exhausted :n ping-pong long before the
muscles used in sending and returning
balls can be affected to any appreciable
extent."
•— -\ ISEASES with strange names have
Dloliowtd in the wake of ping-pong,
J.ut the real pang is not a fanciful

Ail ping-pong devotees, even experts,
suffer from the ping-pong eye more or

that they do not dress properly. They
